<h1>About Booyah</h1>
<p>Booyah Bing is fictional, and the world should be grateful for that.</p>

<p>These are exercises for a web design class someone who is almost certainly not Booyah Bing is taking. That would explain the rudimentary naature of the projects. </p>

<p>With that in mind, you already know too much, and I should have shut up a paragraph ago. But I'm a writer and there is no editor involved here. Any personal details about Booyah Bing are completely fabricated, and photos are representations of what Booyah might look like as translated by AI.</p>

<p>Although I will say they are derived from an genuine photograph of the real guy, and some of them are actually pretty close, while simultaneously being utterly devoid of reality.</p>
