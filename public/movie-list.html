<h1>Booyahs Must See</h1>
<h2>Horror Movies</h2>
<p>This exercise was presented as a "Top 3 Best Ever"...blah blah blah.<br><br>
I don't do that. I like it or I don't. There is no "Best" or "Worst."<br><br>
These are people trying to make art. Do you know how hard that is?<br><br>
It's really really hard. Admire anyone who tries. </p>

    <h3>Audition</h3>
        <p>The only horror film I've ever come close to walking out of.
        Not because it was bad. It was too good.<br><br>
        I made it, but only by watching the last 20 minutes through my fingers.</p>
    <h3>One Cut of the Dead</h3>
        <p>A low budget J Horror zombie film with amazing layers.<br><br>
         True to their word, the first 40 minutes of the film is one continuous take.</p>
    <h3>The Babadook</h3>
        <p>Not just a horror movie, but a nice exploration of grief, and its imposing presence in our lives.
